# Hi, I am Mitchell Kelleher 👋

**Software Engineer** | **Systems, experiments, and writeups**

I build software. I run engineering experiments. I write down what I learn.

## The Lazy Log
The Lazy Log is my public notebook. I log experiments, architecture notes, algorithm writeups, and benchmark results.

- Focus: clear problem statements, measured results, and diagrams
- Style: readable first, fun second
- Boundary: personal work only, no proprietary code or data

> Views are my own.

## What I write about
- Algorithms and data structures
- Architecture experiments and tradeoffs
- Performance work and benchmarking methodology
- Implementation notes and lessons learned

## Projects
- **[noodel](https://github.com/tkellehe/noodel)**: a code golfing language I built years ago
- **[boostc](https://github.com/tkellehe/boostc)**: C work and experiments from earlier projects

## Writing format
I try to keep posts skimmable and reproducible:

**Goal → Setup → Results → Takeaways → Repro notes**
